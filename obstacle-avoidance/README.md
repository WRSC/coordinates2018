# Obstacle avoidance

We used two courses, to try to keep the course roughly perpendicular to the
wind.

* `obstacle_course_1.csv` for earlier attempts (roughly East/West)
* `obstacle_course_2.csv` for later attempts (roughly North-East/South-West)

[See Plotting.ipynb for maps of tracks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WRSC/coordinates2018/blob/master/obstacle-avoidance/Plotting.ipynb).

The following teams made valid attempts:

* ENSTA (attempt 2) sailed several lengths along course 2, and successfully
  detected and avoided the obstacle, returning to the course as required.
* SJTU completed one length along course 2.
* Southampton completed one length along course 1.

Of the other teams, Aberystwyth sailed a length along the edge of course 2,
but didn't stay in the course area. Plymouth was starting a length of course 2
when their battery ran out, and the boat lost control.
